## Written Report

Model & Training Procedure Description
Include a section describing the set of experiments that you performed, what ANN architectures you experimented with (i.e., number of layers, number of neurons in each layer), what hyperparameters you varied (e.g., number of epochs of training, (mini-)batch size and any other hyperparameter values, weight initialization scheme, activation function), and what accuracies you obtained on each of these experiments

## Model Performance & Confusion Matrix
Include a section describing in more detail the most accurate model you were able to obtain: the ANN architecture of your model, including number of layers, number of neurons in each layer, weight initialization scheme, activation function, number of epochs used for training, and batch size used for training.

Include a confusion matrix showing results of testing the model on the test set. The matrix should be a 10-by-10 grid showing which categories images were classified as. Use your confusion matrix to additionally report precision & recall for each of the 10 classes, as well as overall accuracy of your model.

## Training Performance Plot
For your best performing ANN, include a plot showing how training accuracy and validation accuracy change over time during training. Graph number of training epochs (x-axis) versus training set and validation set accuracy (y-axis). Hence, your plot should contain two curves.

##Visualization
Include 3 visualizations of images that were misclassified by your best performing model and any observations about why you think these images were misclassified.  You will have to create or use a visualization program that takes a 28-by-28 matrix input and translate it into a black-and-white image
